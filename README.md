This plugin is for health care providers on the HealthKey platform. If you would like to find out more about joining HealthKey visit [our website](https://www.healthkey.health/industry/providers)

Give your customers the option to pay with HealthKey . The "HealthKey Gateway for WooCommerce" plugin provides the option to choose HealthKey as the payment method at the checkout. It also provides the functionality to display the HealthKey logo on the cart page. For each payment that is authorised by HealthKey, an order will be created inside the WooCommerce system like any other order. When the customer authorises your site to use HealthKey, an order is created and set to pending. When the customer subsequently authorises the payment, the order is changed to processing.

This plugin supports both the new Checkout Block and the Classic Checkout block.
